Give me a definition of Subjective Validation Cognitive bias

**Subjective Validation**, also known as the **personal validation effect**, is a cognitive bias where people consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them¹². In other words, individuals are more likely to believe or accept an idea or statement if it presents to them in a personal and positive way¹.

This bias often leads people to perceive two unrelated events to be related because their personal beliefs demand that they be related¹. It's closely related to the Forer effect and is an important element in cold reading¹. Subjective validation is considered to be the main reason behind most reports of paranormal phenomena¹.

An example of subjective validation can be found in horoscopes, which often make vague, easily generalized personal statements, sometimes referred to as "Barnum statements", designed to apply to nearly any individual¹. This can cause one to attribute future success to the horoscope and feel as if their belief in it has been validated¹.

In essence, subjective validation is a confirmation bias towards information that personally benefits one's self-esteem¹. Many of the validations that are given are not necessarily because they are true about recipients but because people wish it was true about themselves¹. This effect can be seen when it comes to health. For example, if someone enjoys eating bacon and they were to come across an article that talks about bacon being healthy, they will tend to believe it more because this "validates" eating more bacon¹.


Give me 10 example scenarios of the Subjective Validation cognitive bias

Sure, here are 10 example scenarios where the Subjective Validation cognitive bias might be observed:


Horoscopes: Individuals may read their daily horoscope and find that the general statements made about their personality or upcoming events resonate with them, even though the same horoscope applies to people of various zodiac signs.

Personality Tests: Participants in a personality test receive a generic personality description that could apply to a wide range of individuals. Despite its generality, they perceive the description as highly accurate and tailored to their unique characteristics.

Fortune Telling: A fortune teller provides a vague prediction about the future to a client. The client interprets the prediction as highly accurate and specific to their life circumstances.

Cold Reading: During a psychic reading, the reader makes general statements that seem specific to an individual's life. The person being read believes the psychic has unique insights into their personal situation.

Astrology: People read their astrological birth charts and feel that the descriptions of their personality traits and future prospects are spot-on, even though the information is often broadly applicable to various individuals.

Self-Help Advice: Someone reads a self-help book containing general advice on happiness and success. They feel a strong personal connection to the advice, believing it is uniquely relevant to their life.

Online Quizzes: Individuals take online quizzes that claim to reveal specific aspects of their personality, intelligence, or compatibility. The vague questions and results are perceived as highly accurate and personally tailored.

Feedback from Others: A person receives feedback from others that is general and not necessarily specific to them, but they interpret it as highly insightful and applicable to their personal qualities.

Psychic Readings: In a psychic reading, the psychic makes general statements about the client's relationships, career, or health. The client feels a strong connection to the predictions and believes the psychic has unique insights.

Personality Horoscopes: Some publications offer personality assessments based on birth months or seasons. Individuals may resonate with the characteristics assigned to their birth period, even though the descriptions are broad and could apply to many people.


Consider the scenario "Personality Horoscopes" and give me a small user story from it

Scenario:

Setting the Stage:

John, an individual concerned about climate change, is our user. He holds a strong belief in the reality of climate change. John comes across a set of temperature data, the temperature data is complex and contains both supportive and ambiguous information about climate change.

Within the temperature data, there is a vague statement that is not clear in its implications. John, being prone to subjective validation bias, tends to interpret ambiguous information in a way that aligns with his existing belief.

Simultaneously, there is another piece of information challenging aspects of his climate change belief within the temperature data. John, influenced by subjective validation bias, may find it difficult to accept or acknowledge this conflicting information.

As John navigates through the information, he realizes how his subjective validation bias plays a role in selectively perceiving data that aligns with his pre-existing beliefs. He becomes aware of the challenge of objectively assessing information when influenced by subjective validation bias.

John acknowledges that being aware of his own biases is essential to critically evaluate information, especially when it comes to topics like climate change. He recognizes the importance of considering diverse perspectives and interpreting data objectively. Inspired by his newfound awareness, John decides to actively seek out information that challenges his beliefs about climate change.

Through this exploration, John gains insights into his own cognitive biases and the impact of subjective validation on his beliefs. He becomes more conscious of the need to approach information with an open mind, considering both confirming and challenging aspects.

(Even if i asked for the Personality Horoscopes scenario the Bing AI assistant for some reasone decided to give me a user story about an individual called John and his little story about reviewing climate change literature, i decided to tag along).


If you had to make an ontology of the "Subject Validation", what classes and properties would you create?

Individual: Represents an individual who is subject to subjective validation bias.
Belief: Represents a conviction or acceptance that something is true or exists.
Information: Represents data or evidence that can either confirm or challenge a belief.
AmbiguousInformation: Represents information that is not clear or explicit in its meaning.
Confirmation: Represents the act of perceiving information as supporting or confirming a belief.
Challenge: Represents the act of perceiving information as opposing or challenging a belief.
BehavioralOutcome: Represents the behavioral changes or actions resulting from subjective validation in a particular context.
Properties:

holdsBelief: Relates an Observer to a Belief they subscribe to.
providesInformation: Relates an Information to a Belief.
isAmbiguous: Relates AmbiguousInformation to Information, indicating the lack of clarity.
confirms: Relates Confirmation to Information, representing the act of confirming a belief.
challenges: Relates Challenge to Information, representing the act of challenging a belief.
experiencesSubjectiveValidation: Relates an Observer to the act of experiencing subjective validation bias.
now create a list of competency questions in the form of sparql queries and solve them with the ontology you created

After this first conversation with bing's AI assistant, I decided to modify the proposed ontology to make it more streamlined and to make it easier to consult. This is the final result:
Classes:

Action
Belief
InformationObject
Statement
Challenge
Confirmation
Observation
BehavioralOutcome
SocialAgent

Object Properties:

challenges (Challenge -> Belief)
confirms (Confirmation -> Belief)
has_consequence (Action -> BehavioralOutcome)
hasInformationObject (SocialAgent -> InformationObject)
holds (SocialAgent -> Belief)
influences (Belief -> Action)
interpret (SocialAgent -> Statement)
providesInformation (Statement -> Belief)
takesAction (SocialAgent -> Action)

Data Properties:

hasAmbiguity (Statement -> boolean)
hasComplexity (InformationObject -> boolean)
isSupportedByAgent (Challenge or Confirmation -> boolean)


create competency questions (and answers them) in the form of Sparql queries about this ontology
Question: Which beliefs does John hold? SPARQL Query:
SELECT ?belief
WHERE {
    ?john a :SocialAgent ;
          :holds ?belief .
    FILTER (str(?john) = "John")
}

Question: What information objects does John have? SPARQL Query:
SELECT ?informationObject
WHERE {
    ?john a :SocialAgent ;
          :hasInformationObject ?informationObject .
    FILTER (str(?john) = "John")
}

Question: What actions has John taken that have consequences? SPARQL Query:
SELECT ?action ?consequence
WHERE {
    ?john a :SocialAgent ;
          :takesAction ?action .
    ?action :has_consequence ?consequence .
    FILTER (str(?john) = "John")
}

Question: What are the statements that John interprets as ambiguous? SPARQL Query:
SELECT ?statement
WHERE {
    ?john a :SocialAgent ;
          :interpret ?statement .
    ?statement :hasAmbiguity "true"^^xsd:boolean .
    FILTER (str(?john) = "John")
}

Question: What are the challenges that are supported by John? SPARQL Query:
SELECT ?challenge
WHERE {
    ?challenge a :Challenge ;
               :isSupportedByAgent "true"^^xsd:boolean .
}

Please note that these queries assume that the ontology is defined with the prefix :, and that the individuals in the ontology (like “John”) are represented as strings. You may need to adjust the queries based on the actual implementation of your ontology.

John is a SocialAgent who holds a Belief about climate change.
He hasInformationObject, which is the temperature data. This InformationObject hasComplexity and contains both Confirmation and Challenge Statements.
John interprets these Statements. The Confirmation Statement confirms his Belief, and he is likely to accept this due to subjective validation bias. This is represented by the influences relationship between his Belief and his Action of interpreting the Statement.
The Challenge Statement challenges his Belief. However, due to subjective validation bias, he may find it difficult to accept this Statement.
His actions of interpreting the Statements has_consequence, leading to a BehavioralOutcome. In this case, the outcome is his realization of his own bias and decision to seek out information that challenges his beliefs.
