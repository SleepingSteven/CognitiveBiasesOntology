Definition of Subjective Validation: Subjective validation, also known as the personal validation effect, is a cognitive bias where people consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them12. This bias often leads people to perceive two unrelated events to be related because their personal beliefs demand that they be related1. An example of subjective validation can be seen when someone enjoys a certain food, and they come across an article that talks about that food being healthy. They will tend to believe it more because this “validates” their preference1.

User Story: Let’s consider a user story that embodies this bias. Meet Lisa, a marketing manager. Lisa has always believed that her intuition about market trends is exceptionally accurate. One day, she reads a report that suggests a trend she had previously predicted is now emerging. Despite the fact that her previous predictions have not always been accurate, she takes this as validation of her belief in her intuitive abilities. This is an example of subjective validation, as Lisa is interpreting the information in a way that confirms her existing beliefs.

Competency Questions: Based on the user story, here are some competency questions:

What is the belief that Lisa is validating?
What information does Lisa interpret as validation of her belief?
How does subjective validation affect Lisa’s perception of her intuitive abilities?
What might be the impact of subjective validation on Lisa’s decision-making process?

v2:

**Subjective Validation**, also known as the **personal validation effect**, is a cognitive bias where people consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them¹². In other words, individuals are more likely to believe or accept an idea or statement if it presents to them in a personal and positive way¹.

This bias often leads people to perceive two unrelated events to be related because their personal beliefs demand that they be related¹. It's closely related to the Forer effect and is an important element in cold reading¹. Subjective validation is considered to be the main reason behind most reports of paranormal phenomena¹.

An example of subjective validation can be found in horoscopes, which often make vague, easily generalized personal statements, sometimes referred to as "Barnum statements", designed to apply to nearly any individual¹. This can cause one to attribute future success to the horoscope and feel as if their belief in it has been validated¹.

In essence, subjective validation is a confirmation bias towards information that personally benefits one's self-esteem¹. Many of the validations that are given are not necessarily because they are true about recipients but because people wish it was true about themselves¹. This effect can be seen when it comes to health. For example, if someone enjoys eating bacon and they were to come across an article that talks about bacon being healthy, they will tend to believe it more because this "validates" eating more bacon¹.

Give me 10 example scenarios of the Subjective Validation cognitive bias

Sure, here are 10 example scenarios where the Subjective Validation cognitive bias might be observed:


Horoscopes: Individuals may read their daily horoscope and find that the general statements made about their personality or upcoming events resonate with them, even though the same horoscope applies to people of various zodiac signs.

Personality Tests: Participants in a personality test receive a generic personality description that could apply to a wide range of individuals. Despite its generality, they perceive the description as highly accurate and tailored to their unique characteristics.

Fortune Telling: A fortune teller provides a vague prediction about the future to a client. The client interprets the prediction as highly accurate and specific to their life circumstances.

Cold Reading: During a psychic reading, the reader makes general statements that seem specific to an individual's life. The person being read believes the psychic has unique insights into their personal situation.

Astrology: People read their astrological birth charts and feel that the descriptions of their personality traits and future prospects are spot-on, even though the information is often broadly applicable to various individuals.

Self-Help Advice: Someone reads a self-help book containing general advice on happiness and success. They feel a strong personal connection to the advice, believing it is uniquely relevant to their life.

Online Quizzes: Individuals take online quizzes that claim to reveal specific aspects of their personality, intelligence, or compatibility. The vague questions and results are perceived as highly accurate and personally tailored.

Feedback from Others: A person receives feedback from others that is general and not necessarily specific to them, but they interpret it as highly insightful and applicable to their personal qualities.

Psychic Readings: In a psychic reading, the psychic makes general statements about the client's relationships, career, or health. The client feels a strong connection to the predictions and believes the psychic has unique insights.

Personality Horoscopes: Some publications offer personality assessments based on birth months or seasons. Individuals may resonate with the characteristics assigned to their birth period, even though the descriptions are broad and could apply to many people.





Consider the scenario "Personality Horoscopes" and give me a small user story from it


Scenario:

Setting the Stage:

John, an individual concerned about climate change, is our user.
He holds a strong belief in the reality of climate change, represented by the instance ClimateChangeBelief.
Encountering Information:

John comes across a set of temperature data, represented by the instance TemperatureData.
The temperature data is complex and contains both supportive and ambiguous information about climate change.
Ambiguity in the Data:

Within the temperature data, there is a vague statement (VagueStatement) that is not clear in its implications.
John, being prone to subjective validation bias, tends to interpret ambiguous information in a way that aligns with his existing belief.
Confirmation Bias in Action:

John notices a piece of information (Confirmation1) in the data that appears to support his ClimateChangeBelief.
Due to his subjective validation bias, he readily accepts and reinforces this confirming information.
Facing Challenges to the Belief:

Simultaneously, there is another piece of information (Challenge1) challenging aspects of his ClimateChangeBelief within the temperature data.
John, influenced by subjective validation bias, may find it difficult to accept or acknowledge this conflicting information.
Reflecting on Subjective Validation Bias:

As John navigates through the information, he realizes how his subjective validation bias plays a role in selectively perceiving data that aligns with his pre-existing beliefs.
He becomes aware of the challenge of objectively assessing information when influenced by subjective validation bias.
Learning Opportunity:

John acknowledges that being aware of his own biases is essential to critically evaluate information, especially when it comes to topics like climate change.
He recognizes the importance of considering diverse perspectives and interpreting data objectively.
Behavioral Outcome - Taking Action:

Inspired by his newfound awareness, John decides to actively seek out information that challenges his beliefs about climate change.
This proactive behavior is represented by an instance of the class BehavioralOutcome.
Conclusion:

Through this exploration, John gains insights into his own cognitive biases and the impact of subjective validation on his beliefs.
He becomes more conscious of the need to approach information with an open mind, considering both confirming and challenging aspects.

now create a list of competency questions in the form of sparql queries and solve them with the ontology you created

Sure, here are some example competency questions in the form of SPARQL queries for the ontology:

1. **Query: Retrieve all instances of the SubjectiveValidation class.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?subjectiveValidation
   WHERE {
      ?subjectiveValidation rdf:type :SubjectiveValidation .
   }
   ```

2. **Query: Find individuals who have experienced subjective validation and the context in which it occurred.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?individual ?context
   WHERE {
      ?individual :isExperiencedBy ?subjectiveValidation .
      ?subjectiveValidation :occursInContext ?context .
   }
   ```

3. **Query: List all the statements involved in instances of subjective validation.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?subjectiveValidation ?statement
   WHERE {
      ?subjectiveValidation :involvesStatement ?statement .
   }
   ```

4. **Query: Retrieve individuals and the specific behavioral outcomes resulting from subjective validation.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?individual ?context
   WHERE {
      ?individual :resultsInBehavior ?context .
   }
   ```

5. **Query: Identify the different contexts in which subjective validation occurs.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?context
   WHERE {
      ?subjectiveValidation :occursInContext ?context .
   }
   GROUP BY ?context
   ```

6. **Query: Find all cognitive biases, including instances of SubjectiveValidation.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?cognitiveBias
   WHERE {
      ?cognitiveBias rdf:type :CognitiveBias .
   }
   ```

Note: These SPARQL queries are examples and might need adjustments based on the specific structure and data in your ontology. Additionally, the queries assume a namespace prefix (`rdf:` and `:`) for the ontology, and you may need to replace those with your actual namespace declarations.
