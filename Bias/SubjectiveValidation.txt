Definition of Subjective Validation: Subjective validation, also known as the personal validation effect, is a cognitive bias where people consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them12. This bias often leads people to perceive two unrelated events to be related because their personal beliefs demand that they be related1. An example of subjective validation can be seen when someone enjoys a certain food, and they come across an article that talks about that food being healthy. They will tend to believe it more because this “validates” their preference1.

User Story: Let’s consider a user story that embodies this bias. Meet Lisa, a marketing manager. Lisa has always believed that her intuition about market trends is exceptionally accurate. One day, she reads a report that suggests a trend she had previously predicted is now emerging. Despite the fact that her previous predictions have not always been accurate, she takes this as validation of her belief in her intuitive abilities. This is an example of subjective validation, as Lisa is interpreting the information in a way that confirms her existing beliefs.

Competency Questions: Based on the user story, here are some competency questions:

What is the belief that Lisa is validating?
What information does Lisa interpret as validation of her belief?
How does subjective validation affect Lisa’s perception of her intuitive abilities?
What might be the impact of subjective validation on Lisa’s decision-making process?
I hope this helps with your project! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

v2:

**Subjective Validation**, also known as the **personal validation effect**, is a cognitive bias where people consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them¹². In other words, individuals are more likely to believe or accept an idea or statement if it presents to them in a personal and positive way¹.

This bias often leads people to perceive two unrelated events to be related because their personal beliefs demand that they be related¹. It's closely related to the Forer effect and is an important element in cold reading¹. Subjective validation is considered to be the main reason behind most reports of paranormal phenomena¹.

An example of subjective validation can be found in horoscopes, which often make vague, easily generalized personal statements, sometimes referred to as "Barnum statements", designed to apply to nearly any individual¹. This can cause one to attribute future success to the horoscope and feel as if their belief in it has been validated¹.

In essence, subjective validation is a confirmation bias towards information that personally benefits one's self-esteem¹. Many of the validations that are given are not necessarily because they are true about recipients but because people wish it was true about themselves¹. This effect can be seen when it comes to health. For example, if someone enjoys eating bacon and they were to come across an article that talks about bacon being healthy, they will tend to believe it more because this "validates" eating more bacon¹.

Give me 10 example scenarios of the Subjective Validation cognitive bias

Sure, here are 10 example scenarios where the Subjective Validation cognitive bias might be observed:


Horoscopes: Individuals may read their daily horoscope and find that the general statements made about their personality or upcoming events resonate with them, even though the same horoscope applies to people of various zodiac signs.

Personality Tests: Participants in a personality test receive a generic personality description that could apply to a wide range of individuals. Despite its generality, they perceive the description as highly accurate and tailored to their unique characteristics.

Fortune Telling: A fortune teller provides a vague prediction about the future to a client. The client interprets the prediction as highly accurate and specific to their life circumstances.

Cold Reading: During a psychic reading, the reader makes general statements that seem specific to an individual's life. The person being read believes the psychic has unique insights into their personal situation.

Astrology: People read their astrological birth charts and feel that the descriptions of their personality traits and future prospects are spot-on, even though the information is often broadly applicable to various individuals.

Self-Help Advice: Someone reads a self-help book containing general advice on happiness and success. They feel a strong personal connection to the advice, believing it is uniquely relevant to their life.

Online Quizzes: Individuals take online quizzes that claim to reveal specific aspects of their personality, intelligence, or compatibility. The vague questions and results are perceived as highly accurate and personally tailored.

Feedback from Others: A person receives feedback from others that is general and not necessarily specific to them, but they interpret it as highly insightful and applicable to their personal qualities.

Psychic Readings: In a psychic reading, the psychic makes general statements about the client's relationships, career, or health. The client feels a strong connection to the predictions and believes the psychic has unique insights.

Personality Horoscopes: Some publications offer personality assessments based on birth months or seasons. Individuals may resonate with the characteristics assigned to their birth period, even though the descriptions are broad and could apply to many people.





Consider the scenario "Personality Horoscopes" and give me a small user story from it


User Story: Sarah, a 28-year-old marketing professional, regularly reads her monthly personality horoscope in a popular magazine. One day, she comes across her horoscope for the month of February, which suggests that she will face challenges at work but will find success through collaboration and creativity.

Excitedly, Sarah reflects on her current work projects and ongoing collaborations within her team. While the horoscope's predictions are somewhat general, she interprets them as strikingly accurate for her situation. Feeling motivated and reassured, Sarah decides to focus more on teamwork and innovative approaches in her projects throughout the month.

As the month progresses, Sarah encounters some work-related challenges, as predicted by the horoscope. However, she actively embraces collaboration and introduces creative solutions to overcome obstacles. At the end of the month, she reflects on the successful completion of her projects and attributes her achievements to following the guidance outlined in her horoscope.

In this user story, Sarah experiences subjective validation by finding personal relevance in the general statements of her monthly horoscope, influencing her behavior and approach to work throughout the month.


If you had to make an ontology of the "Subject Validation", what classes and properties would you create?

Building an ontology for "Subjective Validation" involves defining classes to represent key concepts and properties to capture relationships between these concepts. Here's a basic outline for an ontology:

Class: CognitiveBias

This ontology provides a basic structure for understanding subjective validation, its context, the individuals involved, and the statements that contribute to the bias. Keep in mind that ontologies can be more complex and detailed based on specific use cases and requirements.
This expanded ontology provides a deeper understanding of the Subjective Validation by considering the source of information, the emotional aspect, the pre-existing beliefs of the individual, and the underlying cognitive biases. It can be further refined or expanded based on the specific use case or domain of interest. Remember, the goal of an ontology is to model the domain of interest in a way that captures its essential aspects and allows for useful reasoning.

now create a list of competency questions in the form of sparql queries and solve them with the ontology you created

Sure, here are some example competency questions in the form of SPARQL queries for the ontology:

1. **Query: Retrieve all instances of the SubjectiveValidation class.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?subjectiveValidation
   WHERE {
      ?subjectiveValidation rdf:type :SubjectiveValidation .
   }
   ```

2. **Query: Find individuals who have experienced subjective validation and the context in which it occurred.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?individual ?context
   WHERE {
      ?individual :isExperiencedBy ?subjectiveValidation .
      ?subjectiveValidation :occursInContext ?context .
   }
   ```

3. **Query: List all the statements involved in instances of subjective validation.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?subjectiveValidation ?statement
   WHERE {
      ?subjectiveValidation :involvesStatement ?statement .
   }
   ```

4. **Query: Retrieve individuals and the specific behavioral outcomes resulting from subjective validation.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?individual ?context
   WHERE {
      ?individual :resultsInBehavior ?context .
   }
   ```

5. **Query: Identify the different contexts in which subjective validation occurs.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?context
   WHERE {
      ?subjectiveValidation :occursInContext ?context .
   }
   GROUP BY ?context
   ```

6. **Query: Find all cognitive biases, including instances of SubjectiveValidation.**
   ```sparql
   SELECT ?cognitiveBias
   WHERE {
      ?cognitiveBias rdf:type :CognitiveBias .
   }
   ```

Note: These SPARQL queries are examples and might need adjustments based on the specific structure and data in your ontology. Additionally, the queries assume a namespace prefix (`rdf:` and `:`) for the ontology, and you may need to replace those with your actual namespace declarations.
