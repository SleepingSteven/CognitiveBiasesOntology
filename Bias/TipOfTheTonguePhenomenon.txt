Definition of Tip of the Tongue Phenomenon: The Tip of the Tongue (TOT) phenomenon, also known as lethologica, is a cognitive bias where an individual fails to retrieve a word or term from memory, despite having partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent12. People experiencing the TOT phenomenon can often recall one or more features of the target word, such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound, meaning, or both sound and meaning1. This phenomenon reveals that lexical access occurs in stages1.

User Story: Let’s consider a user story that embodies this bias. Meet Emily, a college student. Emily is studying for her final exam in art history. While reviewing her notes, she comes across the name of a famous painting that she can’t fully remember. She knows that it’s a well-known work by Van Gogh, and she can vividly recall the image of the painting in her mind, but she just can’t seem to remember the name. She has a strong feeling that she knows the name and that she’s about to remember it any second now. This is an example of the Tip of the Tongue phenomenon.

Competency Questions: Based on the user story, here are some competency questions:

What is the information that Emily is trying to retrieve?
What details can Emily recall about the information she’s trying to retrieve?
How does the Tip of the Tongue phenomenon affect Emily’s study process?
What might be the impact of the Tip of the Tongue phenomenon on Emily’s performance in her final exam?

Give me a definition of the Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon (cognitive bias)

The **Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon**, also known as **lethologica**, is a cognitive bias where an individual fails to retrieve a specific word or term from memory, despite having partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent¹². The phenomenon's name comes from the saying, "It's on the tip of my tongue"¹.

People experiencing this phenomenon can often recall one or more features of the target word, such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound and/or meaning¹. They report a feeling of being seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while searching for the word, and a sense of relief when the word is found¹.

This phenomenon is universal and can occur more frequently with age². It's important to note that while an occasional tip-of-the-tongue state is normal, it can be referred to as an actual medical condition, known as anomic aphasia, when it becomes frequent enough to interfere with learning or daily life².

Give me 10 example scenarios of the Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon

Sure, here are 10 example scenarios where the Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon might be observed:

1. **Names**: You run into an old acquaintance and can't remember their name, even though you can recall specific details about them.
2. **Movies**: You're trying to remember the title of a movie. You remember the plot and the actors, but the title eludes you.
3. **Song Lyrics**: A song is playing, and you know the melody and most of the lyrics, but there's one line that you just can't recall.
4. **Vocabulary**: During a conversation or while writing, you struggle to find a specific word that perfectly expresses what you want to say.
5. **Exams**: During a test, you struggle to recall an answer that you studied and knew well before.
6. **Geography**: You're trying to name a country or city that you know the location of on a map, but the name escapes you.
7. **Historical Dates**: You're trying to remember the date of a significant historical event. You remember the event in detail, but the exact year is just out of reach.
8. **Book Titles**: You can describe the plot of a book and its characters, but you can't remember the book's title.
9. **Famous Quotes**: You remember the gist of a famous quote and who said it, but can't recall the exact wording.
10. **Recipes**: You're trying to remember a recipe. You remember most of the ingredients and steps, but there's one part that you can't recall.

Remember, the Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon is a cognitive bias where an individual fails to retrieve a specific word or term from memory, despite having partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent.


Consider the scenario "names" and give me a small user story from it

Sure, here's a small user story based on the "Names" scenario:

> Meet Emily, a social butterfly who loves meeting new people. At a networking event, she met a woman who shared interesting insights about a project similar to Emily's work. They had a great conversation, and Emily wanted to connect with her later on LinkedIn.

> A few days later, Emily decided to find the woman on LinkedIn. She remembered the woman's face, her project details, and even the color of her dress, but she couldn't recall her name. Emily knew it started with an 'A', and it was on the tip of her tongue, but she just couldn't retrieve it from her memory.

> This is an example of the Tip of The Tongue Phenomenon. Despite having partial recall (the first letter of the name), Emily was unable to fully retrieve the name from her memory. She felt a sense of frustration as she knew that she knew the name, but just couldn't recall it at that moment.

> Eventually, after some time, the name "Amanda" suddenly popped into Emily's mind. She felt a sense of relief and quickly searched for Amanda on LinkedIn. This experience reminded Emily of the peculiarities of human memory and how the feeling of knowing something can sometimes be just out of reach.
