1) Can you talk to me about the experimenter Bias?

Experimenter bias is a type of bias that can occur in research when the experimenter's expectations or beliefs influence the results of the study. This bias can arise in various forms throughout the research process, from study design to data collection and analysis. 

2) Can you create a user story based on this bias?


Once upon a time in the bustling city of Brightville, Dr. Smith embarked on a thrilling adventure to unravel the mysteries of human emotions. Armed with curiosity and a keen intellect, Dr. Smith set out to conduct a pioneering study on the effects of color on mood.

As participants eagerly entered the colorful rooms, Dr. Smith observed with anticipation, curious to see how their moods would be affected by the different hues. In the red room, participants seemed to exude happiness and energy, while in the blue room, they appeared relaxed and serene amidst the cool hues.

After a day filled with adventure and data collection, Dr. Smith reflected on the potential impact of experimenter bias and vowed to analyze the results with rigor and impartiality

3) If you should make an ontology of the "experimenter bias", what classes and properties would you create? 

Classes:

Researcher: Represents individuals conducting scientific studies.
Study: Represents a research project investigating a specific topic or hypothesis.
Experimental Room: Represents a room used in the study to expose participants to different colors.
Participant: Represents individuals recruited to take part in the study.
Data: Represents the information collected during the study, such as mood responses.
Analysis: Represents the process of interpreting and analyzing collected data.
Object Properties:

conductsStudy: Relates a researcher to the study they lead.
usesExperimentalRoom: Relates a study to the experimental rooms used in the research.
assignedToRoom: Relates a participant to the experimental room they are assigned to during the study.
providesData: Relates a participant to the data they provide during the study.
analyzedBy: Relates the collected data to the analysis process.
Individuals:

DrSmith: An individual representing the researcher leading the study.
ColorMoodStudy: An individual representing the specific study on the effects of color on mood.
RedRoom, BlueRoom, YellowRoom, GreenRoom: Individuals representing the different experimental rooms painted with specific colors.
Participant1, Participant2, Participant3, ...: Individuals representing the participants recruited for the study.
MoodData1, MoodData2, MoodData3, ...: Individuals representing the mood data collected from each participant.
StatisticalAnalysis: An individual representing the analysis process applied to the collected data.

4) Can you make competency questions that this ontology should answer and express them both via natural language and via sparql?

What are the names of the experimental rooms utilized in Dr. Smith's study on color and mood?

SELECT ?room
WHERE {
    ?study rdf:type :ColorMoodStudy ;
           :conductsStudy :DrSmith .
    ?study :usesExperimentalRoom ?room .
}


What is the distribution of participants across the experimental rooms in Dr. Smith's color mood study?

SELECT ?room (COUNT(?participant) AS ?participantCount)
WHERE {
    ?study rdf:type :ColorMoodStudy ;
           :conductsStudy :DrSmith .
    ?participant :assignedToRoom ?room .
}
GROUP BY ?room


What were the mood responses provided by each participant in Dr. Smith's color mood study?

SELECT ?participant ?moodData
WHERE {
    ?study rdf:type :ColorMoodStudy ;
           :conductsStudy :DrSmith .
    ?participant :providesData ?moodData .
}

CRITICS

This is the case in which the AI modelling was the most successful and coherent. I don't have anything to add other than the fact that some logical aspects could be compromised even though the description of the bias is well done.
