1. Give me a definition of the Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that involves the tendency of individuals to selectively seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms their preexisting beliefs or hypotheses while disregarding or undervaluing evidence that contradicts those beliefs. It leads people to unconsciously favor information that aligns with their existing attitudes, opinions, or expectations, thereby reinforcing their initial beliefs and potentially hindering objective evaluation of evidence.


2. Give me 10 example scenarios of the Confirmation Bias

Sure, here are ten example scenarios that illustrate confirmation bias:

1. **Political beliefs**: A person who strongly identifies with a particular political party seeks out news sources and information that support their party's views while ignoring or dismissing information from opposing viewpoints.

2. **Medical diagnoses**: A doctor forms an initial diagnosis based on limited information and subsequently seeks out evidence that confirms their hypothesis, potentially overlooking symptoms or test results that suggest alternative diagnoses.

3. **Investment decisions**: An investor believes that a particular stock will perform well, so they focus on news articles and expert opinions that support their prediction while ignoring warning signs or negative forecasts.

4. **Relationships**: Someone who believes that their romantic partner is unfaithful may interpret innocent actions or behaviors as evidence of infidelity while disregarding evidence to the contrary.

5. **Religious beliefs**: A person interprets ambiguous events or coincidences as signs from a higher power that validate their religious beliefs, while discounting or explaining away evidence that challenges those beliefs.

6. **Criminal investigations**: Law enforcement officials may develop a theory about a crime and then selectively gather evidence that supports their hypothesis, potentially overlooking clues that point to alternative suspects or scenarios.

7. **Scientific research**: A scientist conducting an experiment may inadvertently bias their observations or data collection process to confirm their hypothesis, leading to skewed results that support their preconceived notions.

8. **Product reviews**: A consumer reads online reviews of a product they are considering purchasing, paying more attention to positive reviews that confirm their initial interest while dismissing negative reviews as outliers.

9. **Historical interpretations**: Historians analyzing past events may interpret evidence in a way that aligns with their existing narrative or worldview, potentially ignoring or downplaying evidence that challenges conventional interpretations.

10. **Self-perception**: An individual has a strong belief in their own intelligence or abilities, so they interpret feedback or experiences in a way that confirms their self-perception while discounting evidence of their shortcomings or mistakes.


3.Consider the scenario 'Medical diagnoses' and give me a small user story from it

User Story:
As a patient experiencing persistent symptoms, I seek medical advice to understand the cause of my discomfort and receive appropriate treatment.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. As a patient, I schedule an appointment with my primary care physician after experiencing recurring headaches and fatigue.
2. During the appointment, I describe my symptoms to the physician, emphasizing the severity and frequency of my headaches.
3. The physician conducts a physical examination and orders blood tests to investigate potential underlying causes of my symptoms.
4. The blood test results come back within normal ranges, indicating no obvious abnormalities.
5. Despite the normal test results, I remain convinced that my symptoms must have a serious medical cause, such as a brain tumor.
6. I search online for information about headaches and brain tumors, focusing on articles and forums that confirm my fears and validate my concerns.
7. During a follow-up appointment with my physician, I express my anxiety about the possibility of a brain tumor, citing information I found online as evidence.
8. The physician reassures me that the likelihood of a brain tumor is low based on the normal test results and my overall medical history.
9. However, I continue to insist on further testing, convinced that the physician may have overlooked something.
10. Despite the physician's attempts to address my concerns and provide reassurance, my confirmation bias leads me to seek out additional medical opinions and tests until I receive the diagnosis I fear, contributing to unnecessary anxiety and medical interventions.



4.If you should make an ontology of the “Confirmation bias”, what classes and properties would you create? 

Creating an ontology for the Confirmation Bias involves identifying the main classes, subclasses, and properties relevant to this cognitive bias. Here's a basic structure for such an ontology:

Classes:

1. **Confirmation Bias**: The main class representing the cognitive bias.
        - Subclasses: None in this basic ontology, but could include specific types of confirmation biases if needed.

2. **Individual**: Represents a person or entity susceptible to confirmation bias.
        - Properties: 
                - HasBeliefs: Indicates the beliefs or hypotheses held by the individual.
                - ReceivesInformation: Indicates the information received by the individual.
                - InterpretsInformation: Indicates how the individual interprets received information.

3. **Information**: Represents data or evidence that the individual encounters.
        - Properties: 
                - SupportsBeliefs: Indicates whether the information supports the individual's existing beliefs.
                - ContradictsBeliefs: Indicates whether the information contradicts the individual's existing beliefs.

Properties:

1. **HasBeliefs**: Describes the beliefs or hypotheses held by an individual.
        - Domain: Individual
        - Range: String or concept representing beliefs

2. **ReceivesInformation**: Describes the information received by an individual.
        - Domain: Individual
        - Range: Information

3. **InterpretsInformation**: Describes how an individual interprets received information.
        - Domain: Individual
        - Range: String or concept representing interpretation

4. **SupportsBeliefs**: Indicates whether the information supports the individual's existing beliefs.
        - Domain: Information
        - Range: Boolean (true/false)

5. **ContradictsBeliefs**: Indicates whether the information contradicts the individual's existing beliefs.
        - Domain: Information
        - Range: Boolean (true/false)

This ontology provides a basic framework for representing confirmation bias and its related concepts. It allows for the modeling of individuals, their beliefs, the information they encounter, and how they interpret that information in the context of confirmation bias. Additional classes, subclasses, and properties could be added for more detailed modeling or to accommodate specific use cases.



5. give me 5 competency questions (and the sparql queries to answer them) related to this ontology

Sure, here are five competency questions related to the ontology of confirmation bias, along with the corresponding SPARQL queries:

      ```

These SPARQL queries can be executed against RDF data conforming to the confirmation bias ontology to answer the respective competency questions.
