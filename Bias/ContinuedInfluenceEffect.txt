Definition of Continued Influence Effect: The Continued Influence Effect (CIE) is a cognitive bias referring to the tendency for misinformation to continue influencing people’s thinking and decision-making even after it has been corrected or debunked12. This effect occurs when individuals maintain their belief in false information, and it continues to shape their understanding and interpretation of related topics, despite being exposed to factual corrections1.

User Story: Let’s consider a user story that embodies this bias. Meet Sarah, a health-conscious individual. Sarah read an article online claiming that drinking eight glasses of water a day is essential for good health. Later, she came across several scientific articles debunking this myth, explaining that the amount of water needed varies from person to person. However, despite reading these corrections, Sarah continues to believe in the “8 glasses a day” rule and makes sure to follow it religiously. This is an example of the Continued Influence Effect, as the debunked information continues to influence Sarah’s behavior.

Competency Questions: Based on the user story, here are some competency questions:

What is the misinformation that Sarah believes in?
What corrections has Sarah been exposed to regarding this misinformation?
Despite the corrections, how does the misinformation continue to influence Sarah’s behavior?
What might be the impact of the Continued Influence Effect on Sarah’s health decisions?

give me a definition of Continued influence effect

The Continued Influence Effect (CIE) is a psychological phenomenon referring to the tendency for misinformation to continue influencing people’s thinking and decision-making even after it has been corrected or debunked1. This effect occurs when individuals maintain their belief in false information, and it continues to shape their understanding and interpretation of related topics, despite being exposed to factual corrections1.

Key components of the Continued Influence Effect include:

Misinformation: This false information, either intentional or accidental, often fills gaps in understanding or provides simple explanations to complex issues, making it attractive to many individuals1.
Correction: The correction is an attempt to rectify the false information with accurate, verifiable facts. However, due to various reasons, such as cognitive dissonance or the backfire effect, the correction may not completely eradicate the belief in misinformation1.
Continued Influence: Despite the correction, the misinformation continues to exert influence over a person’s beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors1.
The implications of the Continued Influence Effect are vast and profound. In the era of digital media and information overload, the CIE can contribute to the persistence of misinformation, leading to the spread of false beliefs and misconceptions1. This can have significant effects in areas such as public health, politics, and environmental issues, where false information can lead to harmful decisions and behaviors

Give me 10 example scenarios of the Continued Influence Effect

Sure, here are 10 example scenarios where the Continued Influence Effect might be observed:

1. **Vaccines**: Despite numerous studies showing vaccines are safe and effective, some people continue to believe in debunked myths about their dangers.
2. **Climate Change**: Even after being presented with scientific evidence, some individuals still believe that climate change is a hoax.
3. **Flat Earth Theory**: Some people continue to believe that the Earth is flat, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.
4. **Moon Landing**: Some people still believe that the moon landing was a hoax, even after being presented with facts and evidence that it occurred.
5. **Health Myths**: People might continue to believe in health myths (like the idea that cold weather causes colds) even after they've been debunked.
6. **Diet Fads**: Despite scientific evidence debunking certain diet fads, some people continue to believe in their effectiveness.
7. **Financial Scams**: People may continue to believe in the legitimacy of a financial opportunity, even after being informed that it's a scam.
8. **Political Misinformation**: Individuals might continue to believe false political narratives, even after they have been fact-checked and corrected.
9. **Historical Revisionism**: Some people persist in believing inaccurate versions of historical events, despite being presented with accurate historical records.
10. **Superstitions**: Even after learning that superstitions lack scientific basis, some people continue to believe in them.

Remember, the Continued Influence Effect is a cognitive bias where debunked misinformation continues to influence an individual's thinking and decision-making. It's important to be aware of this effect as it can lead to the persistence of misconceptions and false beliefs.

Consider the scenario "Moon Landing" and give me a small user story from it

Sure, here's a small user story based on the "Moon Landing" scenario:

> Meet John, a middle-aged man who grew up during the height of the space race. He's always been fascinated by space exploration, but he stumbled upon a documentary that claimed the moon landing was a hoax. The documentary presented various arguments, such as the waving flag and the absence of stars in the photos, which led John to question the authenticity of the moon landing.

> Despite his doubts, John decided to do his own research. He read numerous articles and watched interviews with astronauts and scientists. Each source debunked the hoax claims and provided logical explanations for the arguments presented in the documentary. For example, the flag appeared to wave due to the way it was planted and the lack of air resistance on the moon, and the stars weren't visible in the photos due to the camera settings used.

> However, even after learning the facts, John found himself still influenced by the documentary. Every time he thought about the moon landing, the hoax claims would resurface in his mind, casting a shadow of doubt. This is an example of the Continued Influence Effect. Despite being corrected, the misinformation continued to influence John's belief about the moon landing.

> Eventually, John realized that he needed to actively remind himself of the facts whenever the hoax claims came to mind. Over time, he was able to reduce the influence of the misinformation, but it was a clear demonstration of how powerful the Continued Influence Effect can be.


4. If you had to make an ontology of the "google effect", what classes and properties would you create?

Sure, let's expand the ontology of the "Continued Influence Effect" to include more classes and properties that capture the complexity of this cognitive bias:

**Classes:**
1. `Individual`: The person exhibiting the Continued Influence Effect.
2. `Misinformation`: The false information that the individual initially believes.
3. `Correction`: The factual information that attempts to debunk the misinformation.
4. `Context`: The specific situation or domain in which the Continued Influence Effect is being exhibited.
5. `Source`: The origin of the misinformation or correction (e.g., media, word of mouth, etc.).
6. `Emotion`: The feelings experienced by the individual when faced with the misinformation or correction.
7. `CognitiveBias`: The underlying cognitive biases that contribute to the Continued Influence Effect (e.g., confirmation bias, belief perseverance, etc.).

**Properties:**
1. `believes (Individual, Misinformation)`: This property indicates that the individual believes in the misinformation.
2. `corrects (Correction, Misinformation)`: This property shows that the correction attempts to debunk the misinformation.
3. `exhibitsIn (Individual, Context)`: This property shows the context in which the individual is exhibiting the Continued Influence Effect.
4. `relatesTo (Misinformation, Context)`: This property links the misinformation to the context in which it exists.
5. `originatesFrom (Misinformation/Correction, Source)`: This property indicates the source of the misinformation or correction.
6. `feels (Individual, Emotion)`: This property captures the emotions felt by the individual when faced with the misinformation or correction.
7. `influencedBy (ContinuedInfluenceEffect, CognitiveBias)`: This property shows the cognitive biases that contribute to the Continued Influence Effect.

This expanded ontology provides a deeper understanding of the Continued Influence Effect by considering the source of information, the emotional aspect, and the underlying cognitive biases. It can be further refined or expanded based on the specific use case or domain of interest. Remember, the goal of an ontology is to model the domain of interest in a way that captures its essential aspects and allows for useful reasoning.

now create a list of competency questions in the form of sparql queries and solve them with the ontology you created

Sure, here are some competency questions that can be answered using the ontology of the "Continued Influence Effect", along with the corresponding SPARQL queries and their solutions:

1. **Question**: Who are the individuals exhibiting the Continued Influence Effect?
    - **SPARQL Query**: `SELECT ?individual WHERE { ?individual :believes ?misinformation . }`
    - **Solution**: This query would return all individuals who believe in misinformation, i.e., exhibiting the Continued Influence Effect.

2. **Question**: In what contexts is the Continued Influence Effect being exhibited?
    - **SPARQL Query**: `SELECT DISTINCT ?context WHERE { ?individual :exhibitsIn ?context . }`
    - **Solution**: This query would return all unique contexts in which the Continued Influence Effect is being exhibited.

3. **Question**: What misinformation is being believed?
    - **SPARQL Query**: `SELECT ?misinformation WHERE { ?individual :believes ?misinformation . }`
    - **Solution**: This query would return all instances of misinformation that are being believed.

4. **Question**: What emotions are felt by individuals when faced with misinformation or correction?
    - **SPARQL Query**: `SELECT ?emotion WHERE { ?individual :feels ?emotion . }`
    - **Solution**: This query would return all emotions felt by individuals when faced with misinformation or correction.

5. **Question**: What are the sources of misinformation or correction?
    - **SPARQL Query**: `SELECT ?source WHERE { ?misinformationOrCorrection :originatesFrom ?source . }`
    - **Solution**: This query would return all sources of misinformation or correction.

6. **Question**: What cognitive biases contribute to the Continued Influence Effect?
    - **SPARQL Query**: `SELECT ?cognitiveBias WHERE { :ContinuedInfluenceEffect :influencedBy ?cognitiveBias . }`
    - **Solution**: This query would return all cognitive biases that contribute to the Continued Influence Effect.

Please note that these queries are hypothetical and would require a populated RDF dataset based on the ontology to return actual results. The ontology provides a framework for structuring this data, and SPARQL queries can then be used to retrieve specific information from the dataset.

The statement:

SocialAgent and (isInfluenced value true) and (keepInfluencing some (Information and (isCorrect value false)))

describes a specific subset of SocialAgent instances that satisfy all the conditions. It does not impose any requirements on all SocialAgent instances.

So, an instance can be a SocialAgent without satisfying these conditions. However, to be considered part of this specific subset of SocialAgent instances (those that are influenced by incorrect Information), it must satisfy all these conditions.

In other words, these conditions are not necessary for an instance to be admitted into the SocialAgent class, but they are necessary for an instance to be considered as being influenced by incorrect Information.
