Definition of Continued Influence Effect: The Continued Influence Effect (CIE) is a cognitive bias referring to the tendency for misinformation to continue influencing people’s thinking and decision-making even after it has been corrected or debunked12. This effect occurs when individuals maintain their belief in false information, and it continues to shape their understanding and interpretation of related topics, despite being exposed to factual corrections1.

User Story: Let’s consider a user story that embodies this bias. Meet Sarah, a health-conscious individual. Sarah read an article online claiming that drinking eight glasses of water a day is essential for good health. Later, she came across several scientific articles debunking this myth, explaining that the amount of water needed varies from person to person. However, despite reading these corrections, Sarah continues to believe in the “8 glasses a day” rule and makes sure to follow it religiously. This is an example of the Continued Influence Effect, as the debunked information continues to influence Sarah’s behavior.

Competency Questions: Based on the user story, here are some competency questions:

What is the misinformation that Sarah believes in?
What corrections has Sarah been exposed to regarding this misinformation?
Despite the corrections, how does the misinformation continue to influence Sarah’s behavior?
What might be the impact of the Continued Influence Effect on Sarah’s health decisions?
