Definition of Semmelweis Reflex: The Semmelweis Reflex, also known as the “Semmelweis Effect”, is a cognitive bias that describes the reflex-like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms1. This term is named after Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who discovered in 1847 that childbed fever mortality rates fell ten-fold when doctors disinfected their hands with a chlorine solution before moving from one patient to another1. Despite the overwhelming empirical evidence, his fellow doctors rejected his hand-washing suggestions, often for non-medical reasons1.

User Story: Let’s consider a user story that embodies this bias. Meet Dr. Smith, a seasoned medical practitioner. Dr. Smith has always believed in a certain treatment method for a particular disease based on his years of experience. When a new research study comes out suggesting a more effective treatment method, Dr. Smith immediately dismisses it, believing that his tried-and-true method is superior. This is an example of the Semmelweis Reflex, as Dr. Smith is rejecting new knowledge that contradicts his established beliefs.

Competency Questions: Based on the user story, here are some competency questions:
